<h2><font color="#4d0000">Defining “Crime of Moral Turpitude”</font></h2>
<p><font color="#1a0008">
Written opinions from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) describe moral turpitude as a “nebulous concept,” and one that “refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality and the duties owed between man and man, either one's fellow man or society in general.” The person committing it should have had either an “evil intent” or been acting recklessly.
This collection of words seems to point to a highly subjective determination— if the immigration official or judge thinks the crime sounds morally wrong, or perhaps mean and nasty, it’s probably a crime of moral turpitude.
There has been a great deal of legal wrangling over the issue of whether, in making this determination, the immigration official may look not only at the language of the law under which the person was convicted (paying attention to each separate element), but at the actual record of and facts surrounding the person’s conviction. 
Why is this important? Because if the immigration judges or officials were limited to looking only at the statute, then the immigrant’s lawyer could argue something like, “This statute doesn’t require that the person INTENDED to commit the crime in order to be convicted, therefore we can’t assume that my client meant to do it, so it’s not a crime of moral turpitude.” But if the facts around the particular crime make it perfectly clear that the defendant acted intentionally, then the lawyer would lose this type of argument.
For a while, the former attorney general of the United States allowed immigration officials to look at the full record. But in 2015, the new attorney general said this was wrong, so now all that the courts and officials can consider in assessing whether a crime involves moral turpitude is the language of the criminal statute under which the person was convicted. If that statutory language can possibly describe some kind of crime that doesn’t necessarily involve moral turpitude, the immigrant may be in luck.
Among the many specific offenses that the government and courts have determined to be CMTs in individual cases are:<br>
murder <br>
voluntary manslaughter <br>
involuntary manslaughter, in some cases <br>
rape <br>
spousal abuse <br>
child abuse <br>
incest <br>
kidnaping <br>
robbery <br>
aggravated assault <br>
mayhem <br>
animal fighting <br>
theft <br>
fraud, and <br>
conspiracy, attempt, or acting as an accessory to a crime if that crime involved moral turpitude.

Existing crime record management system
In the existing crime management system, most of the operations are done manually like send complaints, taking actions against crimes, view status etc. This system need more man power to track the records of crimes. The existing system doesn’t have system security. The existing system is time consuming and not very user friendly.So with the existing system if anybody wants to complaint against crimes he must do it through the police. Retrieving old crime records is very time consuming. In the current system all work is done on papers so it is very difficult to secure crime reports data. Error detection in the previous entries made and data cross verification is another important function. These are done manually, and it would take time. the existing system has more workload for the authorized person, but in the case proposed System, the user can registered in our site and send the crime report and complaint about a particular city or person.

<h3><font color="#4d0000">Proposed crime records management system</font></h3>
<p><font color="#1a0008">
The proposed crime records management system can overcome all the limitations of the existing system. The system provides proper security and reduces the manual work. The efficiency of the police function and the effectiveness with which it tackles crime depend on what quality of information it can derive from its existing records and how fast it can have access to it. The existing system has several disadvantages and many more difficulties to work well. The proposed system tries to eliminate or reduce these difficulties up to some extent. It is proposed to centralize Information Management in Crime for the purposes of fast and efficient sharing of critical information across all Police Stations across the territory. The proposed system helps the user to work user friendly and he can easily do his jobs without time lagging.
